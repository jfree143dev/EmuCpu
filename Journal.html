<H1>Joseph Freeman's Journal => 166 hrs</H1>

<Ul>
<H3>Week 1 => 19 hrs</H3>
	<UL>
		<LI>2009-09-10 => 10 hrs</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>"Worked on designing Qt 4 Interface with threading. Ran into issue with the thread that turned out to be my own stupidity...I was accidently overriding one of the virtual functions that QThread provides. I also added the data manipulation stuff.</LI>
		</UL>
	</UL>

	<UL>
		<LI>2009-09-11 => 5 hrs</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Added more functionality to the interface.</LI>
		</UL>
	</UL>

	<UL>
		<LI>2009-09-12 => 4 hrs</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Added the loader and checksum stuff with UI connections. The database wasn't up so I couldn't really work on that part at all (no ability to test my ideas).</LI>
		</UL>
	</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<H3>Week 2 => 10 hrs</H3>
	<UL>
		<LI>2009-09-20 => 10 hrs</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Created the user interface, no database or loader connection yet in the main interface (though I have done the database in the phase 1)</LI>
		</UL>
	</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<H3>Week 3 => 18 hrs</H3>
	<UL>
		<LI>2009-09-28 - 2009-09-29 => 12 hrs</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Worked on the database issue alot. Finally found (by reading the code) that the QTDS driver isn't complete and doesn't seem to support hardly anything.</LI>
			<LI>I then used the pure C FreeTDS library with connected perfectly (as far as I can tell) to the database and executes stored procedures correctly.</LI>
			<LI>I created a C++ wrapper class for everything I needed to do with the C FreeTDS library.</LI>
		</UL>
	</UL>

	<UL>
		<LI>2009-09-30 => 6 hrs</LI>
		<UL>
			<LI>Worked on a seamless interface for three different types: Register<T>, MemoryAddress<T>, and Immediate<T>.</LI>
			<LI>It supports reading and writing to the underlying types with no effort at all. Just use the overloaded assignment operators (=, +=, *=, -=, /=, %=, etc.)</LI>
			<LI>Each type can also be made to support Signals and Slots if need be (Register<T> already uses libsigc++ which in the UI <=> CPU layer is translated to QT Signals and Slots.)</LI>
		</UL>
	</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<H3>Week 4 => 7 hrs</H3>
	<UL>
		<LI>2009-10-01 => 7 hrs</LI>
